1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
    Server-side: When browsing, the adjustment of a URL can make a lot of things happen. This will happen regularly by clicking on a link, which in turn will request a new page from the server. This is what we call a server-side route. A whole new document is served to the user. A server-side request causes the whole page to refresh. This is because a new GET request is sent to the server which responds with a new document, completely discarding the old page altogether.
    Client side: A client-side route happens when the route is handled internally by the JavaScript that is loaded on the page. When a user clicks on a link, the URL changes but the request to the server is prevented. The adjustment to the URL will result in a changed state of the application. The changed state will ultimately result in a different view of the webpage. This could be the rendering of a new component, or even a request to a server for some data that the application will turn into some HTML elements. It is important to note that the whole page wonâ€™t refresh when using client-side routing. There are just some elements inside the application that will change.
